# Save Me From My Saves

Directories with blend files sure do get ugly when "save versions" is set
to more than 0 or 1. This addon replaces the built-in versioned saves,
and lets you move them to subdirectories, alternate drives, whatever.

## WARNING

I use this addon every day and I've never had any issues (or lost any files),
but that doesn't mean it's bug-free. If it eats your homework, don't blame me,
I'm just providing it in case someone else finds it useful.

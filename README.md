# Save Me From My Saves

Directories with blend files sure do get ugly when "save versions" is set
to more than 0 or 1. This addon replaces the built-in versioned saves,
and lets you move them to subdirectories, alternate drives, whatever.

## WARNING

Don't use this addon until there's an official release, unless you
don't care about your data. Seriously. Don't.
